# Components

The list of Pincello's recommended components is organized into three categories: **essentials**, **sensors** and **actuators**.

## Essentials

Essential items don't do much on their own. However, in different ways they are all essential parts of Pincello.

- `1x` [Organizer Box](essentials.md#organizer-box)
- `1x` [Micro USB Cable](essentials.md#micro-usb-cable)
- `1x` [ESP8266 NodeMCU 1.0 Microcontroller](essentials.md#esp8266-nodemcu-10-microcontroller)
- `1x` [830 Points Breadboard](essentials.md#_830-points-breadboard)
- `140x` [Rigid Jumper](essentials.md#rigid-jumper)
- `20x` [330Ω Resistor](essentials.md#_330%ce%a9-resistor)
- `20x` [10kΩ Resistor](essentials.md#_10k%ce%a9-resistor)

## Sensors

Sensors allow the perception of things in the physical world and translate that information to digital form. It is possible to perceive many things, from natural phenomena such as environmental conditions, to the intentional press of a button.

- `1x` [Humidity and Temperature (DHT11)](sensor-humidity-and-temperature-dht11.md)
- `1x` [Luminosity (LDR)](sensor-luminosity-ldr.md)
- `1x` [Sound (KY-038)](sensor-sound-ky-038.md)
- `1x` [Reflexive Obstacle (FC-51)](sensor-reflexive-obstacle-FC-51.md)
- `1x` [Vibration (SW-420)](sensor-vibration-sw-420.md)
- `6x` [Push Button](sensor-push-button.md)
- `14x` [Push Button Cap](sensor-push-button.md#push-button-caps)

## Actuators

Actuators allow the transformation of digital information into something that reaches out to the physical world. This may happen in the form of light in specific colors, sounds, or even movement, depending on the used actuators.

- `2x` [RGB LED](actuator-rgb-led.md)
- `4x` [Red LED](actuator-led.md)
- `4x` [Yellow LED](actuator-led.md)
- `4x` [Green LED](actuator-led.md)
- `4x` [Blue LED](actuator-led.md)
- `4x` [White LED](actuator-led.md)
- `1x` [Buzzer](actuator-buzzer.md)
- `1x` [Micro Servo (SG90)](actuator-micro-servo-sg90.md)
