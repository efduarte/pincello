# Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)

The ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) is a relatively simple and easy to use sensor that makes use of the speed of sound ðŸ”Š to detect distance (I know, science is great!). In this regard, it is similar to the sonar system of a submarine, or the parking sensor in a car ðŸš— that warns you when you get too close to the vehicle behind you.

The code below is a minimal example that displays the distance between any object in front of the sensor. One of the pins acts as a trigger, and the other waits for the response (echo), and the distance is calculated according to the duration between the trigger and the echo (sound travels at around 340 m/s, and it has to go to the object and come back).

?>**ðŸ¤” Weird reading?** If the sensor fails to detect anything, it will instead return its maximum possible value (it can vary between sensors, but it is usually between 3 and 4 meters). If needed, you can filter any result beyond a certain value (for instance, anything beyond 3000 cm) and return a custom message like `Out of range!`.

```arduino
const int trigger_pin = D0;
const int echo_pin = D1;

int distance;

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);
    pinMode(trigger_pin, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(trigger_pin, LOW);
    pinMode(echo_pin, INPUT);
}

void loop()
{    
    digitalWrite(trigger_pin, HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(10);
    digitalWrite(trigger_pin, LOW);

    distance = pulseIn(echo_pin, HIGH) * 0.034 / 2;
    
    Serial.print("Distance (cm): ");
    Serial.println(distance);
}
```
